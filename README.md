Codebase for the data analyses for "Capturing the microbial dark matter in desert soils using culturomicsbased metagenomics and high-resolution analysis" (Published article on npj Biofilms and Microbiomes: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41522-023-00439-8).

The scripts folder contain almost all necessary original data and scripts to reproduce the analysis results in the article. Most of the scripts take .RDS R structures containing R objects that contain the raw data used to perform the analyses. Some similar graphic codes are listed with only one representative one as a case study.

If you have any doubts about the scrips or data in this folder, please contact lish397@mail.sysu.edu.cn.
